2a. About my assembly:
There are two contigs generated by my assembly, one N50 with the length of 5.3Mb (5,336,434)
and the coverage of 24%, and another with length of 181kb (181,960) and the coverage of 13%.
The total length of my assembly is 5.5Mb (5,518,394). The estimated genome size calculated is 
5.45Mb (5,449,491), which is 0.05Mb difference with the actual, final assembly length. 

2b. number of SNPs is 123 and number of indels is 84, total 207 variations.

3. N50: 17033b
